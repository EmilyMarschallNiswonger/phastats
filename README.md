# Phastats

A gene sequence statistics tool

In comparison to Fastqc, our goal is to make a tool that takes in an argument fastq file and outputs a html file containing similar information. In running our Sequence Statistics tool, the metrics of the resulting html file would include quality distribution, length distribution, and general, useful counts including mean read length and mean quantity of the reads.
